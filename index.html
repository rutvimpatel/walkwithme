	 Final Project : Walk With Me

	 This is a web application that aims to connect UW students or faculty with other students or faculty who are in need of an umbrella on a rainy day. Those with umbrellas will be able to share with others by listing themselves as "sharers" on a map of the area in our application. Users in need of an umbrella will be able to search, find these "sharers" on the map, and contact them to meet up and walk together. The goal of this project to promote socialization and engagement within the UW community. -->

				<p> Walk With Me was created to provide an umbrella sharing service to UW students who are in need of cover from the rain or looking to share their umbrella with fellow students. Users can login to share their umbrella or find to find an umbrella that is being shared.  On days without rain, the service will be offered as a simple walk/jog meetup application. The purpose of this site is to not only create a fun opportunity to socialize and meet new people, but to also encourage a more engaging and inclusive campus environment.
